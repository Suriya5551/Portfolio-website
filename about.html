                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I am Ravi kumar in my final semester, currently living in Bangalore and searching for web development jobs. Although I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering, I have always had a passion for coding and web development.

                    Throughout my academic journey, I have actively pursued opportunities to enhance my web development skills. I have completed several online courses and have taken part in various coding challenges to further my knowledge in this field. I have also been regularly working on developing my own web applications and websites to apply what I have learned and expand my portfolio.
                    
                    I have experience in developing websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks such as React and Angular. I am also proficient in using various web development tools and platforms such as GitHub, Node.js, and MongoDB.
                    
                    My dedication and passion for web development have driven me to seek out opportunities to work with like-minded individuals and organizations. I am excited about the prospect of working in a web development role, where I can apply my skills to real-world projects and continue to grow as a developer.</p>
